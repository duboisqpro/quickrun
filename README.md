## Features

- **Menu bar access** — click the icon to open a compact panel with all your actions
- **Action tiles** — run or stop any script in one click, with live status color feedback
- **Workspaces** — group actions by project and filter them instantly
- **Shell support** — bash or zsh, with optional profile loading (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`)
- **Advanced scripts** — multiline commands, custom working directory, environment variables, timeout
- **Run history & logs** — view output logs per run, with live scrolling
- **Trash** — deleted actions go to the trash and can be restored
- **Export / Import** — backup and restore your configuration as JSON
- **Launch at login** — optionally start Quickrun with macOS
- **Theme** — light, dark, or system

## Requirements

- macOS 13 Ventura or later
- Xcode 15+

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quickrun.git
cd quickrun
open Quickrun.xcodeproj
```

Build and run with `⌘R`. The app is **not sandboxed** so it can execute arbitrary shell scripts with your user privileges.

## Configuration

Actions and workspaces are stored as JSON in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Quickrun/actions.json
~/Library/Application Support/Quickrun/workspaces.json
~/Library/Application Support/Quickrun/trash.json
```

You can edit these files manually or use **Settings → Export / Import** to back up and restore your configuration.
